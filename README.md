# Dash2Beam
Dash2Beam is an ESP-based dashboard for school projectors. Core functions are mapped to a button matrix on a 3D-printed panel. An onboard web interface lets any device on the school Wi-Fi control the projector. Designed as a school project, it brings practical IoT innovation to the classroom.

**This Project is still a Prototype. So please acknowledge bugs or functional issues.**

The project was part of the SIA Student Engineering Academy Freiburg â€” more at: freiburg-seminar.de/sia
